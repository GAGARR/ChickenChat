<hr>
<strong>The definiton of Copyright is stated down below</strong>
<p>Common law copyright is the legal doctrine which grants copyright protection based on common law of various jurisdictions, rather than through protection of statutory law. ... These are ordinarily preempted by federal copyright law, but for some categories of works, common law (state) copyright may be available.</p>
<hr>
<p>In part, it is based on the contention that copyright is a natural right and creators are therefore entitled to the same protections anyone would be in regard to tangible and real property. The proponents of this doctrine contended that creators had a perpetual right to control the publication of their work (also see perpetual copyright).</p>
